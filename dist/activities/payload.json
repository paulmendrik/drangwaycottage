The beaches are renowned and there are delightful gardens and fascinating National Trust properties to visit, the Eden Project is within reach, as are the charming fishing villages of Boscastle, Port Isaac, Clovelly and Padstow - how about a meal at Rick Stein’s  ?","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The walking is superb - footpaths in every direction. Along blustery cliff tops and on wild moors littered with stone hut circles and grazed by highland cattle; over rolling farmland and in sheltered wooded valleys; on wide expanses of sand and through isolated Cornish hamlets. There is a file of some of our favourite walks in the cottage for your use, but just a glance at an Ordinance Survey map of the area will show you the myriad of footpaths throughout the area, some very close to Drangway.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Stratton is a charming and historic village and the battle of Stamford Hill between the Roundheads and Cavaliers is re-enacted every year with a colourful parade. A walk around the streets taking in St Andrew’s church (where you can see the original village stocks!) and the many pretty and interesting cottages is a must. The Tree Inn just down the road is a great place to visit. In the back bar at the Tree you can sit by the woodburner, drink Cornish ales, have an excellent meal and chat to the locals - the people of Stratton are very friendly and welcoming.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Bude, itself, is a fascinating place. It grew in the 19th century when the canal was built and has a wide selection of shops and restaurants. Coffee in Wroes department store with wonderful views over the river, castle, beach and out to sea, or a sunset walk out on the breakwater, there is plenty to see and do.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Places to eat can also be found in the many pretty village and country pubs around the area, such as Crackington Haven, Boscastle, Welcome, Morwenstow and Marhamchurch.","spans":[]}],"body":[{"slice_type":"banner","slice_label":null,"items":[{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":300},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/bf6d53df-426c-48ef-a9ad-69ca1524e367_activities-logo.png?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":300},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/d43a9db3-b864-42f7-9668-740f592aa3a1_activities-header01.jpg?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":300},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/97d025e5-c2b1-45e7-8ada-16f3c293c192_activities-header02.jpg?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":300},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/13e9e478-db26-49dd-81f4-39fa73dec200_activities-header03.jpg?auto=compress,format"}}],"primary":{}}]},"slices":[{"slice_type":"banner","slice_label":null,"items":[{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":300},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/bf6d53df-426c-48ef-a9ad-69ca1524e367_activities-logo.png?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":300},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/d43a9db3-b864-42f7-9668-740f592aa3a1_activities-header01.jpg?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":300},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/97d025e5-c2b1-45e7-8ada-16f3c293c192_activities-header02.jpg?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":300,"height":300},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/13e9e478-db26-49dd-81f4-39fa73dec200_activities-header03.jpg?auto=compress,format"}}],"primary":{}}]}]

Drangway (shown left of centre above) is a charming and comfortable 2 bedroom cottage with views over the church square. The cottage has been in our family for over a hundred and twenty years when our great great aunt Lizzie ran a wine shop in what is now the dining room, and dates from the fourteenth century with the front extension added in Georgian times - we uncovered old carved pews used in its construction! The cottage’s Cornish name comes from the alleyway at one side of the cottage which in medieval times was used by monks to get to the church.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"North Cornwall is a wonderful place to visit and Stratton is a peaceful village one mile inland from Bude. Stratton is a laid back village community with pubs and a great village shop/post office set in a patchwork of narrow streets lined with pretty cottages. You will find a slower pace of life in this part of the world.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Have fun discovering or re-visiting this beautiful area of Britain. At low tide local beaches reveal magnificent expanses of golden sands and fascinating rock pools. Breathtaking National Trust cliff top walks and miles of winding, high hedged, flower and fern laden Cornish lanes are there to be explored - some just a short stroll from the cottage. Beautiful Blue Flag Atlantic surfing beaches are just five minutes’ drive away at both Widemouth and Bude where you will find shops, restaurants, a leisure centre, bowling alley, splash pool, golf courses, seawater swimming pool and large supermarkets.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The cottage is an ideal self-catering base for a memorable walking, touring or beach holiday.","spans":[]}],"body":[{"slice_type":"banner","slice_label":null,"items":[{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":276,"height":276},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/cd1a7955-a78f-4f3c-9132-bb553d5ba06a_logo.png?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":276,"height":276},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/ea6778b5-f26a-458e-9b6e-5a1bd301aced_header01.jpg?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":276,"height":276},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/6d2560a9-6f07-465e-8471-de5c587daf3f_header02.jpg?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":276,"height":276},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/f8c752c0-976b-4126-b6e9-23d763a48a43_header03.jpg?auto=compress,format"}}],"primary":{}}]},"slices":[{"slice_type":"banner","slice_label":null,"items":[{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":276,"height":276},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/cd1a7955-a78f-4f3c-9132-bb553d5ba06a_logo.png?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":276,"height":276},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/ea6778b5-f26a-458e-9b6e-5a1bd301aced_header01.jpg?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":276,"height":276},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/6d2560a9-6f07-465e-8471-de5c587daf3f_header02.jpg?auto=compress,format"}},{"image":{"dimensions":{"width":276,"height":276},"alt":null,"copyright":null,"url":"https://images.prismic.io/drangway/f8c752c0-976b-4126-b6e9-23d763a48a43_header03.jpg?auto=compress,format"}}],"primary":{}}]}]
